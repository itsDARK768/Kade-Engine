Delta Engine is a engine that is based off the kade engine and has very many things in common BUT this is a new engine so dont expect much

If you are reading this when this file is 30 minutes ago the linux release will be ready but i cant make mac and windows releases bc i am chrome os but with the linux thing with it i can install haxeflixel and remove some things bc they say that i cant download polymod, linc_luajit, and extension-webm.
